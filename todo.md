# Documentation tasks

  - hideFromAPIDocumentation
  - overwriting with --force
  - binary responses
  - plugin api: responses - description, $stage property, scribe:strategy
  - --env
  - Use database transactions and `create()` when instantiating factory models
  - fileParams

# Release blocker
- Port recent changes from old repo

# Features
- Possible feature: https://github.com/mpociot/laravel-apidoc-generator/issues/731

# Fixes
- When groups are removed, the markdown files persist, so they remain in the doc
